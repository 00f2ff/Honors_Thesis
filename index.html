/* 
To Do:

Fingers-related:
- Check whether pressing certain Fingers keys changes how the software operates while people interact with my application. If it does, read Fingers code and change those key bindings in a separate branch
- Think about adding 'page loaded' message on success in Etsy class since there's a small delay
- Test out search feature with Fingers on. See if it really changes anything. Space bar might throw things off. See if there's a way to modify that.
- Constrain categories to 6 elements and hardcode it. That means they won't be generated by an Etsy request
- If space in virtual UI, add a message to U, J and M alerting user of "next page"
- Add click handler for U, J and M to go to next page
- Modify code to allow "next page" for products (may involve a limit of 18, then an offset for the next query if I want to keep the code more manageable)
- Modify cell CSS to fit video (reflect it though)
- Remove arrow key code


Reader-related:
- Wait for Jen's email, but probably just make a new, semantic HTML version of my website that doesn't have any Fingers interaction code in it (with exception of back button)
- Try modifying code so that when search bar is being hovered on, cell pressing AND hovering is turned off
-
